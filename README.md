## About

Hi! Iá¸¿ Carolina but please call me Carol :)
Since 2019 I am learning by myself how to programming, and now I work as a software developer @ Procenge, where we have some challenges with Angular framework.
I really enjoy how Git (and Github/Gitlab) can help our lifes when we write code.
Sometimes I like to write about stuff I'm learning, and you can read my blog posts [here](https://github.com/COAB1/blog)

## Public Speaking

I really like to give back some of my knowledge to the comunity, here you can find some of activities through the year
